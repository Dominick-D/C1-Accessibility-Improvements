# Challenge one, Improving accessibility.
Module 1-Challenge;


## Description

I took this existing code for Horiseon buisiness website and made it more accessible for people with disabilities.
I hope the added code to this website is following WCAG guidelines aswell as have semantic elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and posistioning to achieve this goal.
I learned how to use semantic HTML elements aswell as troubleshoot several problems I had along the way.
